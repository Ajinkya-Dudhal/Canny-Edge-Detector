# Canny-Edge-Detector
Canny Edge Detector code without in-built matlab command code is here. Output is compared with in-built command and similarity index(SSIM) is calculated.

Follow below steps:
1. Run "Canny_main_2021EEM1001.m" file.

2. In command window, enter either 1 or 2 or 3 one by one.

3. You can see output images for "1.png", "2.png" and "3.png" separately.

4. In command window, you can see SSIM index.

5. For my code,
	SSIM index for image- 1.png: 0.9882
	SSIM index for image- 2.png: 0.9885
	SSIM index for image- 3.png: 0.9874

6. You can see my logic for Canny Edge Detector in "Canny_fun_2021EEM1001.m".
